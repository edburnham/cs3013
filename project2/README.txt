Project 2

Compile using: make all (compiles LKM)
	       make test (compliles testcalls.c, the test file)
	       
To test interception, load LKM: sudo insmod mckasperfee.ko
Run test file test.txt with "VIRUS" inside via the testcalls program: ./testcalls
Open syslog: tail -n 100 /var/log/syslog

Interception messages generated by printk will be visible for open, close, and read in syslog.

Phase 1:

In phase 1 system calls sys_open, sys_read, and sys_close were intercepted. A copy of these existing system cals were saved and replaced with the new version of these calls. If the uid is 1000 or greater, printk() a message to the syslog and return a pointer to the (original) system call copy. The system call table is he restored towith the original system calls.
